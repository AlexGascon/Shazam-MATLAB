function s = add_tracks(filename,d)

%% add_tracks - Analyzes songs and stores its hashes in a database.
%
% s = add_tracks(filename, d)
%
% This function reads the file called filename that contains info about the songs 
% we want to store in the database d, and processes and stores them. 
%
% The read file must have the following format: it must have a row for each song.
% In each row, it will give us the path of the mp3 we have to read, the group that
% plays it, the album it appeared in, the year it was released, the path of its
% album cover image and the path of a text file containing its lyrics. Each one of
% this piece of information must be separed of the others with a '---'.
%
% EXAMPLE: Canciones/Target/Wonderwall.mp3---Oasis---Live_at_Earls_Court---1995---Imagenes/Wonderwall.jpg---Letra/Wonderwall.txt
%
% add_tracks will output a #songs x 6 cell containing all the info of each one of 
% the songs stored. Besides, it will fill the db with them.
